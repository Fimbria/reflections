When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to do that if I could trust that my work was not significant enough to capture the interest of anyone capable of accessing it on the remote site. In that case, it would have exactly the same benefits of the internet, allowing people to share files quickly and at a distance.
